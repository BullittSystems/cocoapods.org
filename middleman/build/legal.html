<ul>
<li><p>It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or
take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
of the Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</p></li>
<li><p>We transfer information about you if CocoaPods is acquired by or merged with
another company. In this event, CocoaPods will notify you before information
about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>Data</h5>

<p>CocoaPods uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary
hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to
run CocoaPods. Although CocoaPods owns the code, databases, and all rights to the
CocoaPods application, you retain all rights to your data.</p>

<h5>Disclosure</h5>

<p>CocoaPods may disclose personally identifiable information under special
circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate
the Terms of Service</p>

<h5>Changes</h5>

provide notification of the material changes to this Privacy Statement
through the Company’s Web site at least thirty (30) business days prior to
the change taking effect.</p>

COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO
BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH
YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS &quot;YOU&quot; OR
&quot;YOUR&quot; SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
